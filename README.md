**Welcome to Ethordle! the NFT-enabled version of the popular Wordle game.**

Ethordle is a Next.js / Solidity implementation of the word game that swept the internet in 2021/2022.  

If a player's browser is connected to the Ethereum network -- and they guess the correct word -- they can mint an NFT for that solution, and even trade it on the Ethordle token marketplace.

Minting the token is currently free, though the player will pay a certain amount of eth for gas.  Minting ERC721 tokens can be expensive, and the gas price will vary throughout the day.
